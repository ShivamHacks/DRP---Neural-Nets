# DRP - Neural Nets

I am working with graduate student Nathaniel Monson to read chapter 5 of Pattern Recogniton 
and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop. Our goal at the end of the system is to be
able to write a basic classifier for digits using a neural nets.

I wrote a digit classifier from scratch at HopHacks 2017 as a benchmark to compare against
future classifiers we make using neural nets.
